			<h1>OUR PROVIDERS</h1>
			<p>EVERY single one of our providers prides themselves in providing safe, compassionate, and high quality anesthesia care to each and every single one of our patients. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVERY single one of our anesthesia providers has extensive academic hospital experience with high acuity patients and has been employed by large teaching hospitals nationwide such as UCLA and LAC+USC Medical Centers in Los Angeles all the way to Medstar Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., among many others at some point in their career. In addition to having experience with high acuity patients, every one of our providers also has tremendous private practice experience.<br/><br/>
			
			These are two of the many prerequisites to be a member of our group, which ensures that we only have the absolute BEST anesthesia providers working for you. Zero exceptions. Furthermore, we all have extensive experience in private practice plastic surgery where we have provided and continue to provide high-caliber anesthesia care to the patients of some highly reputable and world-renowned plastic surgeons. Every provider is highly competent in providing autonomous and safe anesthesia care to every single one of our patients and are available for services 7 days a week, Monday through Sunday. </p>

			<p>We are more than happy to accommodate you and your facility's needs as it would be an honor to be trusted with your patients' perioperative anesthesia care! We pride ourselves in being extremely affable and strong proponents of patient safety with a tremendous skill set for providing the absolute best quality anesthesia care in every single one of its aspects. We are exclusive in not utilizing anesthesia providers who do not have extensive academic hospital AND private practice experience. This is part of our vision of providing our clients with only the best providers in the market and we hope you consider our professional group should you ever have a need for anesthesia services. We are very selective in our providers and believe that you and your patients deserve an anesthesia provider that is extremely easy and fun to work with, efficient, and highly skilled in every phase of anesthesia care.</p>
