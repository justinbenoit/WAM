			<h1>VISION STATEMENT</h1>
			<p>The founders of Wang Anesthesia Management have seen it all. From past (and current) employments at several large academic hospital anesthesia practices to dozens of previous private practice anesthesia groups in the Southern California area, the founders never came across a private practice anesthesia group that exepmlified the fundamental principles that they had embodied. After many years of seeing this, the motivation and drive to create an anesthesia practice that they had envisioned was realized. <br/><br/>
			
			The vision was to create a boutique anesthesia practice where our providers are happy to work because they feel vested into our practice because they are treated like they deserve to be. We foster open lines of communication and prioritize our providersâ€™ overall well-being knowing full well that only long lasting relationships with both our providers and clients can only exist with our providers being happy first. And we do so by treating each and every one of our providers well. We do not cut corners and only use the best providers in order to be the best. In return, they are compensated well as they should be for they are what makes us who we are.</p>

			<p>Wang Anesthesia Management employs only the highest qualified professionals. Our providers are happy and proud to represent the premiere private practice anesthesia group in Southern California, and as a result, we provide the absolute best anesthetic care to every single patient that we are privileged to care for. Unlike our competitors, we have stringent requirements for employment. This is the only way we can ensure that we only have the VERY best providers in the market and we do not take this lightly. Only by employing the best do our clients and patients get the best. And that, is our vision.</p>
